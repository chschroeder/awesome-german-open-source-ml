| [Explosion](https://github.com/explosion) | Best known for the [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spacy) library, one of the most popular Python packages for everything NLP. It pays off to check their profile for other great repos like [spacy-llm](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-llm) and [curated-transformers](https://github.com/explosion/curated-transformers) | https://github.com/explosion | https://explosion.ai/ | [<img src="res/huggingface_512.png" alt="Explosion on Hugging Face" width="30" height="30">](https://huggingface.co/explosion)
| [Deepset](https://github.com/deepset) | Another young Berlin based company, best known for their LLM framework [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack). Their first step into the limelight was by training a [BERT based German language model](https://huggingface.co/deepset/gbert-base) | https://github.com/deepset | https://www.deepset.ai/ | [<img src="res/huggingface_512.png" alt="deepset on Hugging Face" width="30" height="30">](https://huggingface.co/deepset) |
| [flair](https://github.com/flairnlp) | Developed at the Humboldt University Berlin, flair is a simple framework for state-of-the-art NLP. It is a great alternative to spaCy, especially if you want to use a pretrained model. | https://github.com/flairNLP | https://github.com/flairNLP | [<img src="res/huggingface_512.png" alt="flair on Hugging Face" width="30" height="30">](https://huggingface.co/flair)
| [Mixedbread](https://github.com/mixedbread-ai) | Still very new to the scene, but they have already released an amazing [Sentence Embedding model](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1)| https://github.com/mixedbread-ai | https://mixedbread.ai/ | [<img src="res/huggingface_512.png" alt="flair on Hugging Face" width="30" height="30">](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai)
